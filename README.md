### Hi there 👋 I'm Paul.

I have expert knowledge in building Saas products in an agile environment.

I love leading small yet efficient development teams by creating synergy and enhancing teamwork.

I have been an individual contributor for 10+ years. Mostly Go, some React.

📍 I'm located in Toronto, Canada

💡 I'm the founder of [Spacestation Labs](https://spacestation.github.io), a software consultancy, we help bring tech expertise to startups.

💼 I'm currently CTO at [CloutDesk](https://www.cloutdesk.com/), creating software for creators to manager their business.

🔭 I've cofounded two startups. [Mannr](https://www.getmannr.com/) and [Localyyz](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/localyyz-1-trending-app-shopify-store-stefan-suppa/).

I like to think about new problems, solve old ones better, and always down to hop on a zoom call (or coffee post covid).
