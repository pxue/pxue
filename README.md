### Hi there 👋 I'm Paul.

I'm darn good at leading and building Saas products in a startup environment.

I believe in solving problems driven by real customer needs.

I love leading small yet efficient development teams by creating synergy and enhancing teamwork.

I have been an individual contributor for 10+ years. Mostly Go and React.

📍 I'm located in Toronto, Canada

💡 I'm the founder of [Spacestation Labs](https://spacestation.github.io), a software consultancy, we help bring tech expertise to startups.

💼 I'm currently CTO at [CloutDesk](https://www.cloutdesk.com/), creating software for creators to manager their business.

🔭 I've cofounded two startups. [Mannr](https://www.getmannr.com/) and [Localyyz](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/localyyz-1-trending-app-shopify-store-stefan-suppa/).

I worked at various startups and observed their founders for 10 years before I started my own. I compile my thoughts on how to create a successful business on my blog, among other things. While I love to nerd out on tech, understanding real customer need is what gets me out of bed every morning.

🗞️ I write about startups [on my blog](https://pxue.github.io/).
